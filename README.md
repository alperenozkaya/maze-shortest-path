# Comparison of Different Search Algorithms in Maze Solving

This project is created to compare the four different shortest path-finding algorithms that are commonly used in Artificial Intelligence. For a better approach, a Python-based maze solver is implemented to visualize the four different path-finding algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra, and a Random Walk. The report includes a detailed explanation of how the algorithms work and a comprehensive comparison by observing a variety of cases.


## Use Cases

This project is an excellent tool for learning and teaching the basics of pathfinding algorithms. It's also handy for algorithm enthusiasts who want to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of different approaches. Moreover, the underlying concepts and methods used in this project are applicable in a wide range of fields, including AI, game development, robotics, and logistics.
## Features

* **Flexible Maze Generation:** Users can generate a maze with a customizable size, or choose to load an existing maze from a CSV file.

* **Multiple Algorithms:** This project implements four popular pathfinding algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, and Random Walk. Each algorithm is implemented with utmost precision, and the difference in their functioning is easily visible in the visualized results.

* **Interactive Visualization:** To better understand how each algorithm operates, users can see a real-time visualization of the algorithms traversing the maze. The visualization differentiates between the full search path of an algorithm and the final shortest path that it finds.

* **Performance Metrics:** For each algorithm run, the project provides key statistics like the search path length, the shortest path length, and the execution time.
